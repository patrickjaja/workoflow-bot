# Workoflow Bot

This is a simple Bot connecting n8n to Teams built using the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK v4 for Node.js. It's designed to demonstrate the basic setup and functionality of a bot, including receiving messages and sending responses.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   Bot Framework Emulator
*   Git (for cloning the repository)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your bot up and running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary npm packages:


### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory (e.g., `workoflow-bot/.env`).

*   `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`: Your bot's App ID and Password from the Azure Bot registration. Leave blank if you are not securing your bot or for initial local testing without authentication.
*   `MicrosoftAppType`: Type of Microsoft App. Common values are `UserAssignedMSI`, `MultiTenant`.
*   `MicrosoftAppTenantId`: The tenant ID for your Microsoft App.
*   `WORKOFLOW_PORT`: The port on which the bot server will listen. Defaults to `3978` if not specified.
*   `WORKOFLOW_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`: The url of your n8n webhook.

### 4. Run the Bot

 - npm run watch (or npm run start)

### Testing with Bot Framework Emulator
1.Launch the Bot Framework Emulator.
2.Connect to the bot:â€¢Click on "Open Bot".
    For "Bot URL", enter http://localhost:3978/api/messages (or replace 3978 with the port you configured in WORKOFLOW_PORT in your .env file).
    If you configured MicrosoftAppId and MicrosoftAppPassword in your .env file, enter them into the Emulator's connection dialog. Otherwise, you can leave them blank for local testing if your bot doesn't strictly require them for local emulation.
    Click "Connect". 
3.Send a message: Once connected, type a message in the chat window and send it. The bot should echo your message back to you.
